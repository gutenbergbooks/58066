<p>Through many years before the Revolution and
for a time early in the war, James Craig and
James Geddy the younger were probably Williamsburg&rsquo;s
foremost craftsmen in the jewelry, watch
repairing, and silversmithing way. Geddy&rsquo;s shop stood on
Duke of Gloucester Street &ldquo;next door below the Church,&rdquo;
Craig&rsquo;s Golden Ball still farther down.</p>
<p>At one time Craig advertised in the <i>Virginia Gazette</i>
that he had &ldquo;Just imported from London&mdash;A choice Assortment
of Jewellery, Plate, Toys and fine Cuttlery. There
are some fine visual Spectacles fit for all ages.&rdquo; Not long
afterward in the same paper Geddy listed in some detail
&ldquo;<span class="small">A NEAT</span> Assortment of <span class="small">PLATE, WATCHES, AND JEWELLERY</span>,&rdquo;
and emphasized that &ldquo;the Reasonableness of the above
Goods, he hopes, will remove that Objection of his Shop&rsquo;s
being too high up Town ... and the Walk may be thought
rather an Amusement than a Fatigue.&rdquo; A much more typical
notice was that of Patrick Beech reproduced on the
following page. It bears little resemblance to a modern
newspaper advertisement, but it is so characteristic of its
own time that any one of Williamsburg&rsquo;s several pre-Revolutionary
silversmiths might have penned it.</p>
<p>Fifteen men, possibly sixteen, followed the silversmith&rsquo;s
craft in Williamsburg between 1699 and 1780, while this
small city was the capital of the Virginia colony. Through
the years, most of them took advantage of the newspapers
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
to announce the location of their shops, the arrival of shipments
of goods from London, and the kinds of articles and
services they had to offer.</p>
<p>All of them combined with silversmithing some other
craft, most often that of jeweler or watch repairer. Time
and again they assured prospective purchasers that their
wares, whether country made or imported, were in the very
latest fashion. Each one without exception offered the
&ldquo;highest&rdquo; price for old gold and silver, including gold lace,
either in cash or to be credited against new work. And very
often they felt it necessary to specify that sales would be
&ldquo;for ready money only.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="larger"><b>PATRICK BEECH,</b></span>
<br /><i>At the</i> BRICK SHOP, <i>opposite Mr.</i> Turner&rsquo;s <i>store</i>,
<br /><span class="large">WILLIAMSBURG,</span></p>
<p>BEGS leave to inform the public that he makes and
sells all sorts of GOLD, SILVER and JEWELLERY WORK,
after the newest fashions, and at the lowest prices, for ready money only.
Those who are pleased to favour him with their commands may depend
upon having their work done in the neatest manner, and on the shortest
notice; and their favours will be most gratefully acknowledged.... He
gives the highest prices for old GOLD, SILVER, or LACE, either in
cash, or exchange.... Commissions from the country will be carefully
observed, and punctually answered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, it was a Williamsburg silversmith of a generation
earlier who established a high water mark of colonial
newspaper advertising. After a preliminary notice,
the <i>Virginia Gazette</i> appeared on August 19, 1737, with its
entire back page occupied by the announcement of a lottery
to be held by Alexander Kerr, jeweler and silversmith of
Williamsburg. As if this extravagance on the part of a
Scotsman like Kerr was not startling enough, the same full-page
notice appeared again two weeks later.</p>

<p class="pcap">A typical London goldsmith&rsquo;s trade card or shop bill. This one is reproduced from <i>The London
Goldsmiths, 1200-1800: A Record of the Names and Addresses of the Craftsmen, their Shop-Signs

imagination went into the preparation of Heming&rsquo;s trade card. William Hogarth, the eminent
English artist who served six years as apprentice to a London silversmith, is known to have
engraved two or three goldsmith&rsquo;s trade cards of simpler design.</p>

<p>Kerr proposed to sell 400 tickets at one pistole each and
give 80 prizes worth, at &ldquo;common saleable Prices,&rdquo; a total
of 400 pistoles. (A pistole was the old quarter-doubloon of
Spain, or a similar gold coin, worth about four dollars.) The
top prize in the lottery, a combination of a diamond ring,
an amethyst pin, a heavily jeweled pendant, and an ornamented
gold box, was to be worth 62 pistoles; the other
prizes ranged down to 40 valued at two pistoles each. The
list included rings, earrings, snuff boxes, toothpick cases,
spoons, tongs, gold buttons, buckles, and boxes of various
sorts.</p>
<p>After two postponements, probably in order to sell every
last ticket, the drawing took place &ldquo;at the Capitol.&rdquo; This
doubtless meant on the steps or portico or in the yard,
rather than within the building itself. The outcome was
recorded in a single sentence in the <i>Gazette</i>: &ldquo;Yesterday
Mr. Kerr&rsquo;s lottery of Jewels and Plate was drawn; and the
highest Prize came up in Favour of Mrs. Dawson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kerr&rsquo;s long list of prizes&mdash;and the items listed for sale in
advertisements of other eighteenth-century Williamsburg
silversmiths&mdash;reveal that the articles these smiths made in
their shops, like the ones they imported, were of great
variety but mostly of small size. Besides the silver buckles,
sugar tongs, teaspoons, toothpick cases, and snuff boxes of
the lottery list, other silversmiths advertised thimbles, soup
and punch ladles, salt casters or shakers, watch chains,
cream buckets or &ldquo;piggins,&rdquo; and plated as well as solid silver
spurs. Among these, the soup ladles were the largest items.</p>
<p>If Williamsburg smiths made larger items on special
order as they may have, no such pieces have survived, nor
has any mention of them been found in shop records.
Custom-made articles would not have been advertised, of
course.</p>

<p>Patrick Beech, as his advertisement suggested, was obviously

the Golden Ball, who made a pair of earrings for Washington&rsquo;s

jeweler rather than a Silversmith. James Geddy, Jr., combined
the cleaning and repairing of watches and clocks with silver- and
goldsmithing. John and William Rowsay,
brothers and partners in a Williamsburg shop, sold not only
plate and precious stones, but a wide assortment of general
merchandise, to wit:</p>

<p>This versatility of crafts was almost universal among
colonial silversmiths, especially in the southern colonies.
Not one of the Williamsburg smiths limited himself rigidly
to the making and selling of silver and gold articles. Any
who tried would probably not have enjoyed a large income
in this essentially small town in an essentially rural colony.</p>
<p>Even so, no Williamsburg silver worker was half so versatile
as the most famous silversmith of them all&mdash;a Bostonian
by the name of Paul Revere. Besides being a horseman of
considerable note, Revere was an accomplished designer and
worker in silver, and a skilled engraver on silver and copper.
He drew and engraved political cartoons that helped stimulate
the Revolution, then engraved and printed the first
issues of Continental paper money to help finance it. As the
owner and operator of a copper foundry, he cast church
bells and Revolutionary cannon. He manufactured gunpowder
for a while, too, and made and installed dental
devices that he advertised as being not only ornamental
but also &ldquo;of real Use In Speaking and Eating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several other colonial silversmiths also doubled in dentistry,
a fairly normal coupling of crafts since both demand
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
skill in working silver and gold. This tendency, however,
was deplored by the &ldquo;real&rdquo; dentists of the day, those who
might or might not have had a touch of the slender medical
training then available. But the displeasure of these practitioners
was certainly no greater than that displayed by
the trained silversmiths whenever a blacksmith tried to
edge into their own craft.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there was not the least jealousy
between silversmiths and goldsmiths&mdash;for these are but two
different names for the same craft. All silversmiths are
equally goldsmiths, and vice versa. But long-standing
custom and the prestige attached to the more precious of the
two metals often moved men who worked almost entirely in
silver to proclaim themselves publicly as &ldquo;goldsmiths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James Craig advertised as a jeweler during his first two
decades in Williamsburg. Then when he branched into
silver work he asked to be addressed as &ldquo;Goldsmith in
Williamsburg,&rdquo; and named his shop the &ldquo;Golden Ball.&rdquo;
James Geddy, Jr., customarily advertised as a &ldquo;goldsmith,&rdquo;
but this conceit seems not to have impressed the legal profession
in Williamsburg. Deeds and documents drawn up
by more prosaic hands refer to him twice as &ldquo;silversmith&rdquo;
and once as &ldquo;jeweler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By combining several vocations, some if not all of the
Williamsburg silversmiths seem to have made at least a
respectable living. In addition to those whose names have
already appeared in this account, three others deserve
mention.</p>
<p>John Brodnax was the first to follow the craft in Williamsburg.
The son of a London goldsmith, he originally settled
in Henrico County near what is now Richmond. The date
of his arrival is unknown, but about 1694 he moved to a
forest crossroads seven miles from Jamestown called Middle
Plantation. Five years later this became the colony&rsquo;s
capital &ldquo;city&rdquo; and was renamed Williamsburg. In 1711
Brodnax was appointed &ldquo;Keeper of the Capitol and publick
Gaol&rdquo; at a salary of &pound;30 a year, later raised to &pound;40.</p>

<p>Brodnax died in 1719 leaving an estate of &pound;1,000, a very
considerable amount in those days, including nearly &pound;200
worth of old gold and silver and close to &pound;300 of finished
work. Whether he acquired this estate through silversmithing
alone cannot be determined now. It seems highly
unlikely in view of the limited economy of that time and
place and the experience of others in the craft at a later and
more opulent period. He may well have gained his wealth
by inheritance, by the sale of his backcountry lands to
William Byrd in 1711, or possibly, as so many others did,
from the sale of tobacco produced on those acres.</p>
<p>Anthony Singleton was born in Williamsburg in 1750,
possibly served as apprentice to James Craig, and opened
his own jewelry and goldsmith shop in 1771 opposite the
Raleigh Tavern. Little is known today about Singleton&rsquo;s
career as a craftsman in silver. After making his mark as a
captain of artillery in the Revolution, he moved to Richmond
and married Lucy Harrison Randolph, daughter of
Benjamin Harrison the Signer, sister of William Henry
Harrison the President, and widow of Peyton Randolph of
Wilton.</p>
<p>Although Singleton held a number of public and private
offices of trust and responsibility, and by virtue of his
marriage had gained membership in Virginia&rsquo;s aristocracy,
he most solemnly enjoined in his will that his sons &ldquo;be
brought up to some mechanical profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William Waddill announced in 1767 his intention to open
shop &ldquo;next door below the Old Printing Office&rdquo; in Williamsburg.
He called himself a &ldquo;Goldsmith and Engraver&rdquo; and
offered to buy up old gold and silver and rework it &ldquo;in any
taste the owner chooses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether he did open a business as intended is not known,
but a few years later he was a jeweler and engraver&mdash;and
perhaps a partner&mdash;in the shop of James Geddy, Jr. Since
Geddy married Elizabeth Waddill and named one of his
sons William Waddill Geddy, the two men were presumably
brothers-in-law. Waddill followed Geddy by a few
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
years in leaving Williamsburg to find greener pastures in
the growing cities of Richmond and Petersburg.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>SURVIVING WORK OF WILLIAMSBURG SILVERSMITHS</i></span></h2>
<p>William Waddill&rsquo;s known work illustrates how very slight
is the amount of surviving silver that can be ascribed with
any certainty to Williamsburg smiths. He engraved plates
for the printing of paper currency in Virginia, and he made
a silver nameplate and handles for the coffin of Governor
Botetourt, whose remains lie buried beneath the chapel floor
at the College of William and Mary. The coffin plate, purloined
by Union soldiers during the Civil War, has since
been returned to the college, which has loaned it to Colonial
Williamsburg for display at the restored house and shop
of James Geddy.</p>
<p>Also on display there are several articles of silver that
can now be attributed to the hand of Geddy himself. One
is a small saucepan or pot-like cup, with a straight silver
handle added at a later time; the others are spoons. The
saucepan and three of the spoons bear the &ldquo;I&middot;G&rdquo; maker&rsquo;s
mark of James Geddy, Jr., the &ldquo;I&rdquo; being the eighteenth-century
equivalent of &ldquo;J,&rdquo; at least in certain situations.</p>
<p>The saucepan is believed to have once been the property
of Colonel William Preston, a burgess from Augusta County
for a time before the Revolution. Preston is known to
have purchased other articles from Geddy, and this particular
piece of hollowware has come down through his descendants.
One of the teaspoons marked &ldquo;I&middot;G&rdquo; was found
as long ago as 1930 at the site of the Palace kitchen, but its
attribution to Geddy remained uncertain for nearly forty
years. Then, in 1968, five more silver spoons were unearthed
in the yard behind Geddy&rsquo;s house, two of them having
the identical maker&rsquo;s mark. Another of the excavated
group, a tablespoon, lacks any mark to show the maker, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
does have the initials I<sup>G</sup>E engraved on the handle, almost
certainly those of James Geddy and his wife Elizabeth.</p>
<p>The teaspoon found at the Palace site is also engraved
on the handle in the same fashion but with the initials C<sup>A</sup>A.
Christopher Ayscough was gardener at the Palace in the
time of Governor Fauquier; his wife, Anne, was the governor&rsquo;s
housekeeper. Fauquier thought so highly of Mrs.
Ayscough&rsquo;s stewardship that he bequeathed her &pound;250 sterling,
a very generous sum. Possibly the silver teaspoon
found beneath the brick floor of Anne Ayscough&rsquo;s kitchen
was also a gift from the governor to her and her husband.
How it got under the floor can only be guessed at.</p>
<p>St. Paul&rsquo;s Church in Edenton, North Carolina, possesses
a silver chalice and paten bearing the inscription: &ldquo;The Gift
of Colonell Edward Mosely for the use [of] the Church in
Edenton in the Year 1725.&rdquo; They show the initials AK and
are of American make. George Barton Cutten, author of
<i>The Silversmiths of Virginia</i>, does not hesitate, therefore, in
ascribing them to Alexander Kerr of Williamsburg.</p>
<p>Two theories are at hand to explain why these and a few
other articles are the only ones still in existence that can be
attributed to Williamsburg craftsmen. One is that marauding
Union soldiers carried away in their knapsacks all the
Williamsburg silver they could lay hands on. This theory
is most often advanced south of the Mason and Dixon Line
and has some truth in it, to be sure. But not the entire
truth, apparently. Cutten declares that there is little silver
of southern origin in the northern states today&mdash;less than
might be expected had there been no Civil War.</p>
<p>The other and probably more reasonable explanation is
that Williamsburg silversmiths fashioned few pieces of
plate of any great size. Silver work in Williamsburg, it
appears, was limited mainly to the manufacture of small
articles and to the repair of items large and small.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Everything we know of the time and the people reinforces
the belief that the planters of Virginia&mdash;the only ones
who could afford large outlays in silver&mdash;bought their plate
in London rather than having it made by smiths of the
colony. To the older generation of planters England was
&ldquo;home.&rdquo; They were bound to the mother country by ties of
sentiment and culture. Their church was the Church of
England, their books and songs were English books and
songs, and English-made goods were to them obviously
better than the country-made variety.</p>
<p>So strong was this preference for wares imported from
London that it persisted through the various nonimportation
associations and buy-American movements. In Williamsburg,
curiously enough, the leading silversmiths seem
to have been less enthusiastic &ldquo;associators&rdquo; than were tradesmen
elsewhere&mdash;certainly less enthusiastic than such leaders
of the planter group as George Washington.</p>
<p>Washington, whose preference for British goods was as
strong as anyone&rsquo;s, nevertheless sponsored the nonimportation
agreement adopted at the Raleigh Tavern in May
1769. James Geddy, Jr., in a newspaper advertisement of
that September, declared that he had</p>
<blockquote>
<p>now on hand a neat assortment of country made
<span class="small">GOLD</span> and <span class="small">SILVER WORK</span>, which he will sell at the
lowest rates for cash, or exchange for old gold or
silver. As he has not imported any jewellery this
season, he flatters himself he will meet with encouragement,
especially from those Ladies and
Gentlemen who are friends to the association.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Geddy, however, did not subscribe himself as a member of
the Association until July of 1770, and only three months
later he ventured to advertise, along with country-made
wares, &ldquo;a small, but neat assortment, of imported <span class="small">JEWELLERY</span>
(ordered before the association took place).&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boycotting of British goods, however, was a political
technique adopted for a particular purpose&mdash;to put pressure
on Parliament to repeal the Townshend duties or other
offensive legislation. When that purpose was accomplished,
or seemed certain to be, the old preferences for imported
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
goods reasserted themselves. Thus we find Washington in
August 1770 ordering from London a quantity of expensive
clothing and some jewelry &ldquo;if the Act of Parliament
Imposing a Duty upon Tea, Paper, &amp;ca, for the purpose of
raising a Revenue in America shoud [sic] be Totally repeald
before the above goods are shipped.&rdquo; And by the
next spring Geddy was again advertising goods just imported
from London.</p>
<p>Throughout the colonial period it was generally more
convenient for Virginia planters to acquire high quality
goods in London than in Virginia. This was a consequence
of the narrowly channeled two-way trade between the great
plantations of the Chesapeake Bay and the great commission-merchant
warehouses along the Thames. The planters
grew and exported enormous quantities of tobacco, almost
all of it sent to London and sold there. Against the proceeds
they ordered whatever they needed and wanted of manufactured
necessities and luxuries: textiles, clothing, furniture,
hardware, ceramics, glass, and silver.</p>
<p>To the planter aristocrats, silver plate (not to be confused
with plated silverware) performed three functions at
once. It was a form of stable investment, easily watched
over, easily identified in case of theft, and easily converted
into cash if needed. In the absence of safe-deposit boxes or
bank vaults, silver in daily use was as safe a form of &ldquo;savings&rdquo;
as the times offered. Secondly, plate was a form
of social ostentation in which all members of the group
indulged to a greater or lesser degree. Finally, plate was
useful in the proper serving of the owners and their guests;
a well-to-do planter would have thought it impossible
to get along without quantities of food and drink on his
table, and almost as unthinkable not to have some silver
articles on the table, too.</p>
<p>Although only the wealthy families possessed an occasional
large and elaborate silver piece of London manufacture&mdash;such
as epergnes and monteiths&mdash;many Virginians
not of the planter aristocracy did own silver. Alexander
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
Purdie, for example, one proprietor of the <i>Virginia Gazette</i>,
owned real estate, nine slaves, and 130 ounces of plate
when he died. Other professional men and even artisans in
colonial Virginia also owned silver in amounts that seem
large in contrast to what their modern counterparts generally
possess.</p>
<p>One other circumstance that helps explain the dearth of
silver articles made in Williamsburg was the scarcity of raw
material. There simply was not very much silver or gold
in Virginia for colonial craftsmen to work with. Despite
the great hopes of the early Jamestown settlers&mdash;hopes that
in Captain John Smith&rsquo;s day nearly cost the settlement its
life&mdash;no silver has ever been mined in Virginia, and precious
little gold. For his raw material, the colonial Virginia
silversmith thus had to depend on imports.</p>
<p>Precious metal might come into the silversmith&rsquo;s hands
in any of three forms. One was bullion, bars of the virgin
metal fresh from the mines and refineries of Mexico or
Peru. Another was in the form of minted coins of various
countries. The third consisted of silver or gold articles
already wrought, but available for one reason or another
to be melted down and reworked.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the seventeenth century a certain amount of
bullion reached the English colonies from the Spanish
Main in pirate ships. But there is no reason to suppose that
this flow continued in the eighteenth century&mdash;and certainly
not into Virginia. Governor Spotswood&rsquo;s expedition in 1718
had returned with Blackbeard&rsquo;s head swinging from a
bowsprit and his followers in irons, most of them to be
hanged afterward at Williamsburg.</p>
<p>Of course, pirates would as soon have coin as bullion, and
pirate ships sometimes found haven in colonial ports, especially
in those where no official inquired how poor sailor
men suddenly acquired such great wealth. Some said that
the colonial officials of North Carolina, New England, New
York, and even Pennsylvania could be encouraged to look
the other way on such occasions. At any rate, a sizable
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
amount of silver coin entered the colonies in this fashion,
at least in the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Little of this lucre came directly into Virginia, but
for other reasons than the attitude of the governors. The
rural colonies of the South could offer neither the concealing
refuge of large cities nor the lusty recreation that such
cities in the middle and northern colonies promised to
pleasure-hungry sailors.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth century, however, some coins from
France, Spain, Portugal, Arabia, Mexico, and Peru did
arrive and circulate in Virginia&mdash;pieces of eight, doubloons,
pistoles, pistareens, crusadoes, and &ldquo;dog dollars.&rdquo;
The last, thought to be Dutch in origin, were so called from
the crude representation of a lion on one face. Curiously,
there were few British crowns, half-crowns, or shillings.</p>
<p>Despite this variety, coined money was by no means
plentiful in the colonies in the eighteenth century. The
scarcity of specie, in fact, was one of the strongest colonial
arguments against the stamp tax in 1765. Nevertheless,
coins of known weight and fineness provided the colonial
silversmith with a fairly reliable source of raw material.</p>
<p>The third possible source&mdash;plate to be melted down and
reworked&mdash;was less certain as to quantity but of trustworthy
quality. Customers who wanted articles of silver made in
the newest fashion often had to provide the smith with raw
material&mdash;usually an equal weight of plate in the older
style. If the old pieces had been wrought in England the
mark either of a lion passant or the seated figure of Britannia
attested to the fineness of the metal used.</p>
<p>But this source was of little help to the smiths of Williamsburg.
Although Virginia probably contained as much
concentrated wealth and as much plate as any other colony,
the Virginians who held most of it leaned toward England
in heart and pocketbook. If they wanted their silver refashioned,
where more logical to have it done than in
London&mdash;where fashions were made and where the pieces
had been wrought in the first place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>LEARNING TO BE A SILVERSMITH</i></span></h2>
<p>No one earned the right to be a master craftsman in
silver&mdash;or a master of any other craft&mdash;in the eighteenth
century without serving a long and thorough apprenticeship.</p>
<p>A boy of the working class in England was usually
launched on his life&rsquo;s career by the time he was 14, and
sometimes when he was only 10 or 12. The class of society
into which he happened to be born and his father&rsquo;s vocation
usually determined the road he would take. The oldest
son almost automatically followed the father&rsquo;s trade and
inherited his tools and shop, if he had one.</p>
<p>The same custom prevailed in the English colonies, including
Virginia, but in modified form. Here the freedom
of movement encouraged by the beckoning frontier of opportunity,
and especially of cheap land, broke down many
social and economic barriers. A man of one class could
more easily climb into the class above or aspire to have his
son do so. Even the long-standing apprenticeship system
suffered. Not every man who arrived in the colony, or
moved to its western reaches and set up shop as a master
craftsman, had actually earned the ancient right to employ
that title.</p>
<p>But by and large, colonial boys became colonial craftsmen
only by completing an arduous apprenticeship period of
seven years&mdash;more or less. During this time they learned
the &ldquo;art and mysterie&rdquo; of the craft and gained skill in
using its tools. At the age of 21 they became &ldquo;journeymen&rdquo;
for an additional period until they acquired enough capital
to set up in business for themselves.</p>
<p>Unlike the countries of Europe, the colonies in America
did not have uniform laws regulating every aspect of the
apprenticeship system. Some colonies had no legal regulations
at all, some limited the effect of controls to specified
trades or to certain aspects of apprenticeship, and some had
laws that were honored in the breach more than in the
observance. In sum, the colonies generally did not follow
the European example of employing the authority of government
to insure high standards of training and practice
in the trades and crafts.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The traditions of apprenticeship, however, survived the
ocean crossing somewhat better than the legal sanctions.
Law or no law, the required seven-year minimum for apprenticeship
in England was also customary in America.
This seems to have been especially true of such highly
skilled crafts as silversmithing, although wide variations
appeared in the practice of other crafts.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that young John Goodkin of Williamsburg,
age 13, must be apprenticed out to learn a trade. Apprenticeship
will provide the boy with an assured future livelihood,
and at the same time relieve his father of the burden
of supporting him. The master craftsman who accepts
young Johnny as apprentice will not only teach him the
trade but also provide him with board, lodging, clothing,
and an occasional shilling (but no wages) for the full period
of his apprenticeship. He will also teach Johnny, or see
that he learns, a smattering of the three R&rsquo;s. In return the
master will gain the services of&mdash;he hopes&mdash;a willing and
receptive helper for seven years at minimum cost to himself.</p>
<p>The terms of apprenticeship were sufficiently standardized
and frequently enough resorted to that printed forms
were customarily used, with blank spaces for names and
dates to be inserted. One copied by hand in the York
County Deed book of 1762 reads as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Indenture Witnesseth that John Webb an Orphan
hath put himself ... apprentice to William Phillips of
Williamsburg Bricklayer to learn his Art, Trade and
Mystery; and ... to serve the said William Phillips from
the day of the date hereof for ... five Years next ensuing
during all which Term, the said Apprentice, his said Master
faithfully shall serve, his Secrets keep, his lawful commands
at all Times readily obey; He shall do no damage to his
said Master, nor see it to be done by others, without giving
Notice thereof to his said Master. He shall not waste his
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
said Master&rsquo;s Goods nor lend them unlawfully to any. He
shall not committ Fornication, nor contract Matrimony
within the said Term. At Cards, Dice or any other unlawful
Game he shall not play whereby his said Master may
have damage. With his own Goods, nor the Goods of others
without Licence from his Master, he shall not buy nor sell.
He shall not absent himself day or night from his said
Master&rsquo;s Service, without his Leave, nor haunt Alehouses,
Taverns, or Play Houses, but in all Things behave himself
as a faithful Apprentice ought to do during the said Term.
And the said Master shall use the utmost of his Endeavours
to teach, or cause to be taught or instructed the said Apprentice
in the Trade or Mystery of a Bricklayer and procure or
provide for him sufficient Meat Drink; Cloaths, Washing
and Lodging fitting for an Apprentice....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny Goodkin of Williamsburg may himself want to
be an explorer and trapper in Virginia&rsquo;s endless western
territories. Or, like young Ben Franklin, he may want to
go to sea. But it is his father who makes the decision. And
more often than not the father&rsquo;s own decision is made for
him by whatever openings for apprentices exist at the
moment.</p>
<p>In Johnny&rsquo;s case the decision is easily reached: Mrs.
Goodkin&rsquo;s cousin is a silversmith in Williamsburg and
agrees to accept the boy as apprentice. Thus Johnny can
look forward to a thoroughly respectable career. He may
never rise to the social heights attained by Anthony
Singleton; in fact he is unlikely to. But he may make himself
so well respected by his fellow citizens as to be chosen
by them a member of the city&rsquo;s Common Council. That
honor was bestowed on James Geddy, Jr., in 1767.</p>
<p>As an apprentice to a silversmith, what will Johnny do?
Probably he will arise very early in the morning and do
household chores like any son of the family. One of his
duties in the shop will doubtless be to light the fire in the
forge. If necessary he will replenish the supply of charcoal,
perhaps by fetching a sack from a bakery. The baker
produces charcoal as an incidental by-product in the course
of heating his ovens.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES OF THE COLONIAL SILVERSMITH</i></span></h2>
<p>From the founding of Jamestown to the time of the
Revolution some 300 silversmiths practiced in the three
cities of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia alone.
Another 200 worked in the smaller centers of New England
and the middle colonies and in such southern places as
Charleston, Annapolis, and Williamsburg. Unfortunately,
if any of these 500 colonial silversmiths left a written
account of his shop practices and methods of work, it has
not been found.</p>
<p>Accordingly, our knowledge of the ways in which colonial
smiths worked is derived from other sources. Most of it
comes from a few technical handbooks and illustrated
encyclopedias published in Europe at about the same time.
Inasmuch as many colonial silversmiths gained their knowledge
of the craft and of its standards of good practice as
apprentices in the old country, it is probable that silversmithing
practices in America were similar.</p>
<p>Not identical, though. The environment of the new
country altered in some manner or to some degree almost
every single attitude, habit, and craft practice. For
example, in eighteenth-century England the silversmith
whose shop was located within the purview of an assay
office could sell the articles he made (with certain exceptions)
only after the pieces had been assayed and stamped
with the appropriate hallmarks, including one denoting the
fineness of the metal. Since the colonies had neither assay
offices nor regulations governing the work of silversmiths,
each smith was responsible for the quality of his own work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Because most re-used plate came originally from England
and because coins were generally minted at or near sterling
fineness (925/1000ths fine, or 92.5% pure silver, the rest
of the alloy being copper), most American silversmiths presumably
turned out work that was not too far from sterling
purity. They could not afford to slip much below that level,
after all, since they competed for favor and sales with the
much esteemed plate imported from England. In many
advertisements in the colonial press, smiths explicitly warranted
their work to be of sterling quality. However, among
the pieces of early American silver that have actually been
assayed in recent years, only a portion have met the test;
quite a number have not.</p>
<p>While American smiths no doubt resented the general
preference of their customers for articles of English manufacture,
they could not overlook the fact that English
fashions in design dominated colonial life. Accordingly,
silver of colonial make imitated the London styles in plate,
being usually some years behind them.</p>
<p>But the American designers were neither unimaginative
nor slavish imitators. Their designs modified the English
originals rather freely&mdash;usually in the direction of simplicity
and utility. American silver, dispensing with the heavy
ornamentation for ornament&rsquo;s sake that often characterized
the work of London silversmiths, tended to be substantial,
serviceable, and vigorous in form, befitting the environment
in which it was to be used.</p>
<p>Acquiring a complete set of Silversmith tools, or at least
a reasonably adequate set, must have been something of a
task in itself. When John Coney, a leading Boston silversmith,
died in 1722 at the age of 67, the inventory of his
goods reflected his many years at the craft. Among the
articles listed were 116 hammers, 127 nests of crucibles, 80
anvils of different shapes and sizes (some called &ldquo;stakes&rdquo;
and &ldquo;teasts&rdquo;), and unnumbered punches; plus chisels,
swages, stamps, vises, files, and an almost endless variety
of other tools.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="765" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Various hand tools used by the silversmith, including a small lathe, vises, clamps, caliper,
shears, and pliers.</i> <span class="small">DIDEROT.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>John Burt, another Boston silversmith of the eighteenth
century, got along with only 40 hammers, 15 pairs of tongs
and pliers, 37 &ldquo;bottom stakes,&rdquo; 155 punches, and other
tools in like sparsity. A glance at the illustration on pages
27 and 28 from Diderot&rsquo;s <i>Encyclopedia</i> (published in
France, 1751-1772) indicates the infinite diversity of anvils
that would be needed to produce every possible shape and
size of hollow ware.</p>
<p>Even with all these tools&mdash;plus forge, ingot molds, drawing
bench, binding wire, and many other essentials of the
craft&mdash;the silversmith was limited to six basic methods of
working silver. These were casting, forging, raising, hollowing,
seaming, and creasing&mdash;the principal methods still
employed by hand craftsmen today.</p>
<p>But forging, raising, hollowing, and creasing are all hammering
processes, though they differ significantly in the
manipulation of the metal under the hammer. In essence,
thus, there are only three techniques of forming silver into
an article of desired shape: casting the molten metal in a
properly shaped mold; hammering an ingot into the shape
desired; and building the desired shape from smaller pieces
soldered together. Wire produced on the drawing bench
might be one of these smaller elements. Filing is considered
to be a finishing rather than a forming process.</p>
<p>These forming and working processes, as they would have
been used by an eighteenth-century silversmith, will be
described in more detail in a moment. But the smith,
before he could do any work, had to acquire a supply of
refined metal, probably from his customers. He then
charged them only for his services in fashioning the new
pieces, either a set amount for the type and size of article
or a fixed fee per ounce of silver in the finished article.</p>
<p>Early in the Revolution, for example, General George
Washington ordered a set of 12 silver &ldquo;camp cups&rdquo;
from the Philadelphia Silversmith Edmond Milne. He
supplied Milne with &ldquo;16 silv<sup>r</sup> Doll<sup>s</sup>&rdquo; to make the cups out
of. Possibly these were Portuguese or Brazilian crusadoes
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
or &ldquo;cross dollars.&rdquo; As it turned out, there were 1&frac34; ounces
more silver in the 16 dollars than Milne needed for the 12
cups. He retained the excess for his own use and credited
its value against his charge for workmanship.</p>
<p>Coins went directly into the smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;black lead&rdquo; or
graphite crucible. Old plate had to be broken up first
into pieces of suitable size. Then the crucible was set
down into&mdash;not on&mdash;the charcoal fire in the forge. Charcoal
on top of the melting silver kept it from absorbing
too much oxygen.</p>
<p>Pure silver is a highly ductile and malleable metal with
the relatively low melting point of 1761 degrees Fahrenheit.
Sterling silver melts at an even lower temperature, so only
15 or 20 minutes in the forge, with constant use of the
bellows, would be enough to melt the crucible&rsquo;s charge.
Most impurities in the metal would be sopped up by the
porous graphite of the crucible itself. The molten metal
was then poured out into a two-piece cast iron ingot mold
or into an open mold called a &ldquo;skillet.&rdquo; In either case,
the cooling metal released any oxygen it might have absorbed
in the form of spitting bubbles that left the surface
of the ingot pitted with tiny holes.</p>
<p>If the piece of work to be made was a small ornament, it
would be cast directly in a sand mold formed by the smith
around a pattern of his own making. The acorn-like finials
atop teapots or on the covers of tankards were normally
made by casting, often a dozen at a time.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, some customer ordered a simple,
straight-sided silver cup, too large to be cast. Our smith
could have made it by any one of three methods and the
result would be the same in size, shape, weight, and appearance.
Generally only another silversmith could hope to tell
which was made by which process: forging, raising, or
seaming.</p>
<p>To <i>forge</i> such a cup the silversmith would have taken a
billet of silver perhaps 3/16 inches thick and from it cut a
disk of the same diameter as the lip of the finished cup.
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
Then by careful and repeated hammer blows, using shaped
anvils of the proper size and curvature, he would pound the
metal into the form he required.</p>
<p>To <i>raise</i> a cup, the smith would start with silver in the
form of a flat sheet as thick (or thin) as he wanted the cup
to be. He would have made the sheet himself, of course, by
beating an ingot to the required thinness. From the sheet
he would cut a disk whose diameter equalled the average
diameter plus the average height of the finished cup. By
carefully hammering the silver just beyond the edge of the
anvil, he would force the metal around the outer part of the
disk to rise and &ldquo;shrink&rdquo; until the cup was shaped.</p>
<p>To make a <i>seamed</i> cup the smith would again use thin
sheet, cutting from it a small round piece for the bottom of
the cup and a slightly curved oblong piece to form its side.
He would roll the latter into a somewhat cone-shaped
cylinder and solder together the edges. Then he would
solder the small disk into the lower end of the cylinder so
that the cup was formed. This was by far the quickest and
easiest method of making hollow ware. The silversmith&rsquo;s
solder is itself composed predominantly of silver.</p>
<p>Whatever method the smith used to form the cup, he
would finish it by a process known as planishing. In this
procedure the small irregularities in the surface of the piece
are carefully hammered smooth by repeated, deft blows
of a flat, polished hammer. The face of the planishing
anvil is likewise polished to mirror-like smoothness. After
planishing would come the filing off of burrs in crevices of
the design, and then an all-over polishing with pumice,
tripoli, and rouge. At this point the piece would have
been ready for surface ornamentation&mdash;by engraving, chasing,
or repouss&eacute;.</p>
<p>Engraving means the cutting of a design into the surface
of the work; some metal is removed in the process. Chasing
is the impression of a design on the surface by the use of
appropriately shaped punches. Repouss&eacute; consists of raising
a design, somewhat like bas relief, by hammering from the
back or inside of the work. In the second and third techniques
the metal is displaced but not removed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="762" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Shown here are a few of the larger anvils and stakes on which the silversmiths shaped their
silver into the finished articles. Since the silversmith had no tool the exact shape of the
articles he made, he had to employ many different shaped tools in the process of manufacture.</i>
<span class="small">DIDEROT.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="772" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The silversmith often used small anvils, stakes, and dies. Figure 13, for instance, is a spoon
mold used to make the final shape of the spoon. Figures 16, 18, 20, and 22 are button punches
used to impress a design on smaller pieces.</i> <span class="small">DIDEROT.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Stamping was normally used only in the forming of such
small articles as the bowls of teaspoons. In this procedure a
piece of silver was forged to the desired thickness and outline,
and placed between a hollowed-out lower die and a
rounded upper one. When the smith forced the two dies
together by a blow of his heaviest hammer, the bowl of the
spoon was formed. By filing, planishing, and polishing&mdash;and
possibly some engraving&mdash;the one-piece spoon was
quickly finished.</p>
<p>A soup ladle, having a much larger and deeper bowl,
would have been formed by the raising process, with the
handle made as a separate piece and soldered to the bowl.
In fact, only the simplest articles and the smallest ones
could be formed by one process alone. The accomplished
colonial silversmith had to be able not only to refine and
assay his own silver, but to work it up in any combination
of techniques that the design made most appropriate.</p>
<p>As an example, the body and spout of a teapot might each
have been formed by the seaming process, the base by
forging, the top by raising, the finial by casting, and parts
of the hinges by drawing. Then all the parts would have
been soldered together and the piece planished, polished,
and finished off with engraved, chased, or repouss&eacute; decoration&mdash;or
a combination of these. Finally, the smith would
have attached a wooden handle, which he might have obtained
from a cabinetmaker&mdash;or made himself.</p>
<p>Among the silversmith&rsquo;s final procedures would have
been the stamping of his mark, his initials, or his name on
the piece. This practice of identifying the maker of an
article of gold or silver ware is of long standing, though
perhaps not so ancient as the custom by which a painter or
sculptor signs his work.</p>
<p>Since the year 1300 the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths
of the City of London has been charged by the
British government with assaying gold and silver wares
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
and coins, and certifying that the metals are of required
fineness. Throughout most of this long period the hallmarking
of English silver articles has retained a basic continuity
of tradition. Disregarding certain modifications and
accretions (some noted in the caption above), every piece
of sterling silver made in England since 1544 has borne
four marks stamped on the back, bottom, or side.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="244" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The hallmarks in the first line above and the maker&rsquo;s marks in the second line
illustrate the variety of markings used on English silver. The leopard&rsquo;s head
crowned (<span class="f">A</span>) became the mark of the City of London; <span class="f">B</span> and <span class="f">E</span> are date letters; <span class="f">C</span>
is the lion passant denoting silver of sterling fineness. During the Britannia standard
period (1697-1719), the lion&rsquo;s head erased (<span class="f">F</span>) replaced the leopard&rsquo;s head crowned,
Britannia (<span class="f">D</span>), still optional, replaced the lion passant on London silver, and the
standard of fineness was raised from 92.50% to 95.83%. Also, the law required the
maker to use the first two letters of his last name, for example (<span class="f">G</span>), the mark of
Paul de Lamerie. It was the custom before and after this period for silversmiths to
use initials. The marks of George Wickes, John Tuite, and Dorothy Mills are
shown (<span class="f">H</span>, <span class="f">I</span>, and <span class="f">J</span>) and examples of their work are in Colonial Williamsburg&rsquo;s
collection of English and American silver. Some of George Wickes&rsquo;s tools may be
among those currently used at the Golden Ball and the Geddy Shop.</i></p>
</div>
<p>One is the true hallmark, the symbol of the guildhall
where it was assayed. That of the guild of London goldsmiths
is the head of a leopard and has been in use for the
nearly seven centuries since 1300. Assay offices established
later in a few other cities use other symbols.</p>
<p>Another is the maker&rsquo;s mark, which has been required
since 1363. This mark is now always the maker&rsquo;s initials,
but once was more often his trade symbol.</p>
<p>In 1478 a system was adopted of dating each piece assayed
by stamping it with one letter of the alphabet. For this
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
purpose a twenty-letter alphabet is used, the design of the
letter or of the surrounding panel being changed every
twenty years.</p>
<p>Finally, the mark of English sterling standard fineness&mdash;a
lion passant&mdash;has been used (with one twenty-three-year
interruption) since 1544 to certify that the metal is 92.5 per
cent pure silver. English silver rarely bears the word
&ldquo;sterling,&rdquo; which is commonly found on modern American
silver and on that made in some other countries for sale to
Americans. Hallmarking of British goldware is somewhat
different.</p>
<p>Colonial American silversmiths did not adopt the elaborate
marking tradition of the Old World. In the English
colonies no legal requirements existed for marking of any
kind, the guild system was not transplanted, and until 1814
there was not even an assay office. So colonial smiths put
only their own mark on their work. At first this was composed
of the maker&rsquo;s initials only, but later became more
often his surname, with or without initial. Some smiths also
used a symbol&mdash;John Coney the figure of a rabbit, for example&mdash;but
this was comparatively rare. Of the Williamsburg
silversmiths we have positive or presumed maker&rsquo;s
marks of only two&mdash;James Geddy and Alexander Kerr.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>THE GEDDY SHOP AND THE GOLDEN BALL TODAY</i></span></h2>
<p>Two reconstructed silversmithing shops in Williamsburg
once more stand in the same spots occupied by similar establishments
in the eighteenth century. Both are operating
craft shops where skilled workers in costume produce articles
of gold and silver using methods and tools like those
employed by James Craig, James Geddy, Jr., and other
Williamsburg silversmiths two centuries ago. For reasons
important to twentieth-century visitors, a partial division
of functions has been established: The making of jewelry
and smaller silver items and engraving are emphasized at
the Golden Ball; the casting of silver (done at the Geddy
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
Foundry along with founding in other metals) and the
making of larger pieces, particularly hollow ware, are
more prominent at the Geddy Shop.</p>
<p>The original structure at the site of the Golden Ball,
possibly built in 1724, remained standing until 1907, undergoing
repairs and alterations from time to time. Craig had
his shop in the western portion for a period before 1765,
renting the space from James Carter, surgeon. In that year
he bought the western fifteen feet of the house and lot, and
the next year acquired the rest of it. After Craig&rsquo;s death
the building served its succeeding owners as a residence.
The recollections of several old inhabitants of Williamsburg,
a faded photograph, deeds, tax records, insurance
policies, and excavated colonial brick foundations have all
provided clues in reconstructing the building to its original
outward appearance and inward room arrangement.</p>
<p>As for the shop itself, it has been designed and equipped&mdash;insofar
as careful research and discerning imagination
can make it&mdash;as it might have been in James Craig&rsquo;s day.
Lacking any descriptive material on the contents of the
Golden Ball, the architects and curators have had to draw
on other sources. The forge, for example, was designed and
built in the image of forges described by Benvenuto Cellini
and pictured in Diderot&rsquo;s <i>Encyclopedia</i>. Some of the wall
cabinets were made in imitation of those on display in
European craft museums.</p>
<p>Much the same may be said of the Geddy Shop. Whereas
the two-story, ell-shaped house dates to about 1750, the
two shops of one and a half storys extending to the east of
the house are reconstructed on original foundations still in
the ground. James Geddy, Jr., probably worked on the
premises before 1760, when he bought the house and lot
from his mother. He rented out the easternmost shop but
continued to practice silversmithing&mdash;presumably in the
middle shop&mdash;until 1777 when he moved away and sold the
property.</p>
<p>Since no records survive as to the interior arrangement
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
or contents of the shop, the architects and curators have
again had to use their best judgment and the most appropriate
precedents and parallels in designing and furnishing
the shop. While none of the silversmithing tools now used
in either of the two shops are those of James Craig or James
Geddy, Jr., some of them may have belonged to an English
silversmith of the eighteenth century by the name of George
Wickes. One particular tool, a square &ldquo;stake&rdquo; or anvil,
displayed in the Geddy Shop, once belonged to Paul
Revere. It was given to Colonial Williamsburg by Mrs.
Francis P. Garvan, whose husband&rsquo;s outstanding collection
of American silver is housed at Yale University.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">JAMES CRAIG,
<br />AT THE GOLDEN BALL,
<br />WILLIAMSBURG,</p>
<p>BEGS leave to inform the public that he has just got an eminent
hand in the WATCH AND CLOCK MAKING BUSINESS,
who served a regular apprenticeship to the same in <i>Great Britain</i>, and
will be obliged to those who favour him with their commands. He
makes and repairs REPEATING, HORIZONTAL, and STOP
WATCHES, in the neatest and best manner. JEWELLERY,
GOLD, and SILVERWORK, as usual, made at the above
shop, for READY MONEY only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James Geddy repaired watches, advertising that &ldquo;he
still continues to clean and repair Watches, and repairs
his own work that fails in a reasonable time, without any
expense to the purchaser.&rdquo; Rough castings in brass for
spandrels to decorate the faces of clocks and many fragments
of watch crystals have been found in the course of
archaeological excavation of the Geddy property. On
several occasions James Craig advertised that his customers
could have &ldquo;All Kinds of <span class="small">CLOCKS</span> and <span class="small">WATCHES</span> cleaned
and repaired&rdquo; in his shop, and twice announced that he
had &ldquo;just got an eminent Hand, in the <span class="small">WATCH</span> and <span class="small">CLOCK
MAKING BUSINESS</span>, who served a regular Apprenticeship
to the same in Great Britain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In cabinets of rooms adjoining both shops the visitor
may examine a collection of silver, cutlery, jewelry, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
similar articles made in England and in the colonies during
the eighteenth century. Of particular interest are the black
enameled &ldquo;mourning rings&rdquo; so popular at that time. It was
the custom for a man of wealth to provide in his will for the
purchase of rings to be worn by members of his family and
close friends. All Williamsburg silversmiths and jewelers
advertised that they made mourning rings &ldquo;on the shortest
Notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The contemporary silversmiths at the Geddy Shop and
the Golden Ball do not make mourning rings&mdash;there is not
much call for them these days. They do, however, make
and sell a number of other articles of silver of true eighteenth-century
design. For obvious reasons their supply of
raw material comes from commercial refineries rather than
from melted coins or plate. But they cast the silver, forge
it, raise, seam, and solder it, and decorate the finished products
just as did their predecessors.</p>
<p>Above all, today&rsquo;s silversmith and his co-workers still
hammer the lustrous metal with the same love of beauty
that a sculptor might have. Indeed, the hammer is the
silversmith&rsquo;s most useful and in many ways his most
delicate tool. With it he can produce effects in the metal
that cannot be achieved in any other way. In fact, a fine
silversmith must be able to wield a hammer much as an
artist uses his brush&mdash;as if it were a natural extension of his
arm.</p>
